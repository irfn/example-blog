There might be some practices and rituals of agile that take hold organically in different teams but unless the top management understands the change in the mindset it will never succeed. The reason is that how you measure progress in agile is completely different than how it is done in a traditional waterfall practice.Upfront requirement gathering is replaced by user stories and planning/grooming meetings. Percentage done is replaced by story point completed and the work estimation is based on team velocity. Measurement progress is different in the agile world. CxO should understand the metrics of success in agile delivery and how to report progress in an agile setup.\nRitualistic: Agile is regimented and process-centric. Although some rituals in the agile can be customized to some degree, by and large, you need to follow the methodology to hilt to achieve success. It is not just a philosophy but a practice. Many companies adopt the rituals of an agile approach but fail to adopt the complete process. For example, they may adopt the sprint cycle and standups. For benefits to be realized CXO need to understand and adopt all the rituals Grooming, Planning, Standups, Retrospectives etc. for an agile framework\nWorking as a Team: Agile is about working as a team. In traditional waterfall, each team member is allocated by a certain percentage to a project or work unit. So a team member may work Project A 20% of the time and Project B 50% of the time and task C 30% of the time. A bunch of individuals working together on disparate items is not a team. A team needs to have a single goal and all work done should be focused on a single outcome in mind. There are ways to scale agile when teams have multiple priorities but by and large, a team should be dedicated to a single effort at a time. This is not to say that multiple priorities cannot be stacked together but have to be done one after the other. Multitasking is bad and the context switching involved destroys the productivity of the team.\nRefactoring and technical debt: Agile is not just about the planned work (work directed and planned ahead of time). It can be applied to all the teamwork. A consistent theme in agile is refactoring and reducing technical debt. Technical debt is accumulated over the time due to easy to implement shortcuts and band-aids that have been undertaken. It also refers years of neglect in implementing best practices or principles. In an agile world, a refactoring or addressing of technical debt is considered an essential part of work that needs to be performed. Usually, the technical debt is relegated to the backlog, but one way to address this is to allocate certain story points to unplanned work and technical debt. A CxO should understand the importance of addressing the technical debt and its benefits to the organization.\nDedicated product owner. Waterfall methodology has a laborious upfront lengthy requirement gathering process. Eventually, when the requirements are written they are thrown over the wall for development. Agile is predicated on the belief that the requirements can change throughout the process and with continuous engagement with the business product owner. The presence of a dedicated product owner who drives the product vision is very critical to the success of the agile process. An agile model fosters a very tight relationship between business product owners and IT team. Product owners are part of the team and bear equal responsibility along with the team in a success or failure of an initiative / or sprint.\n")])])])},[],!1,null,null,null);o.options.__file="Readme.md";t.default=o.exports}}]);
